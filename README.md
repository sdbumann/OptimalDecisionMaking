<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The aim of this project is to apply the theoretical concepts linear programming, integer programming, and robust optimization learned in the course Optimal Decision Making [MGT-483](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/optimal-decision-making-MGT-483) to solve Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment problems. The implementation is done in Matlab using Yalmip with MOSEK as solver.
